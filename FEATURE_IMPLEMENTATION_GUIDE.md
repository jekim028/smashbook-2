## üìã Features Overview

### Feature 1: Drag-and-Drop Reordering

#### How it Works:
- Each day now has a **reorder button** (‚ÜïÔ∏è icon) next to the date banner
- Clicking the reorder button enters **Reorder Mode** for that specific day
- In reorder mode:
  - The 2-column grid layout is maintained (just like Apple Photos!)
  - A subtle header appears with instructions: "Long-press and drag to reorder"
  - Long-press any item and drag it to a new position
  - Items snap into place as you drag, creating a smooth experience
  - Other items automatically shift to make room
  - A "Done" button appears to exit reorder mode
- Order is automatically saved to Firestore with an `order` field
- The app sorts memories by the `order` field within each day

#### Technical Implementation:
- **New Component**: `DraggableMemoryGrid.tsx`
  - Always maintains 2-column grid layout (no layout switching!)
  - Uses `react-native-draggable-flatlist` with `numColumns={2}` for drag-and-drop
  - Long-press to drag items within the grid
  - Items scale up (1.08x) and increase shadow opacity when being dragged
  - Automatically saves order to Firestore on reorder
  
- **Updated Components**:
  - `DayDivider.tsx`: Added reorder button and `isReorderMode` state
  - `MemoryFeed.tsx`: 
    - Added `reorderModeDate` state to track which day is in reorder mode
    - Updated memory sorting to prioritize `order` field
    - Integrated `DraggableMemoryGrid` component

#### Database Schema:
- **Memories Collection**: Added `order` field (number)
  ```typescript
  {
    id: string,
    type: string,
    content: any,
    date: Timestamp,
    order: number,  // ‚Üê NEW: Order within the day (0, 1, 2, ...)
    // ... other fields
  }
  ```

### Feature 2: Day Metadata & Sharing

#### How it Works:
- Click on any **date banner** to open the Day Details modal
- In the modal you can:
  - **Add a title** for the day (e.g., "Best Day Ever!")
  - **Add a caption** (e.g., "We went to the beach and had so much fun...")
  - **Share the day** with others (coming soon)
- Title and caption are displayed in the date banner
- Metadata is saved per-user and per-date

#### Technical Implementation:
- **New Component**: `DayMetadataModal.tsx`
  - Modal for editing day title, caption
  - Placeholder for future sharing functionality
  - Saves metadata to Firestore
  
- **Updated Components**:
  - `DayDivider.tsx`: 
    - Now fetches and displays day metadata
    - Made clickable to open metadata modal
    - Shows title and caption in the banner
  - `MemoryFeed.tsx`: 
    - Added `isDayMetadataModalVisible` and `selectedDate` state
    - Integrated `DayMetadataModal`

#### Database Schema:
- **New Collection**: `dayMetadata`
  ```typescript
  {
    id: "{userId}_{YYYY-MM-DD}",  // Composite ID
    userId: string,
    dateString: string,  // "YYYY-MM-DD"
    title: string,
    caption: string,
    sharedWith: string[],  // Future: list of user IDs
    createdAt: Timestamp,
    updatedAt: Timestamp
  }
  ```

#### Firestore Security Rules:
```javascript
match /dayMetadata/{metadataId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated();
  allow write: if isAuthenticated() && metadataId.matches(request.auth.uid + '_.*');
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Deploy Firestore Rules
```bash
cd /Users/juliarhee/Documents/smashbook-2
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 2. Rebuild the App
Since we added new dependencies and updated iOS native code:

```bash
# Kill the Metro bundler (if running)
killall -9 node

# Start Metro with clean cache
npx expo start --dev-client --clear
```

Then in Xcode:
1. Open `ios/Smashbook.xcworkspace`
2. Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
3. Build and Run (Cmd+R) on your iPhone

## üéÆ How to Use

### Using Drag-and-Drop Reordering:

1. **Find a day** with multiple memories in your feed
2. **Tap the reorder button** (‚ÜïÔ∏è icon) next to the date
3. The day enters **reorder mode**:
   - A subtle banner appears: "Long-press and drag to reorder"
   - Grid stays in 2-column layout
4. **Long-press any item** and drag it to a new position
5. **Watch items snap into place** as you drag (just like Apple Photos!)
6. **Tap "Done"** when finished
7. Order is automatically saved!

### Using Day Metadata:

1. **Tap on any date banner** (e.g., "October 23, 2025")
2. The **Day Details modal** opens
3. **Add a title** (e.g., "Beach Day üèñÔ∏è")
4. **Add a caption** (e.g., "Perfect weather, great company!")
5. **Tap "Save"**
6. The title and caption now appear in the date banner

## üé® UI/UX Design Decisions

### Reorder Mode:
- **Why maintain the 2-column grid?** 
  - Matches Apple Photos behavior - familiar and intuitive
  - No jarring layout changes when entering/exiting reorder mode
  - Visual consistency throughout the app
  - Users can see exactly where items will end up
  
- **Visual feedback:**
  - Active drag: Items scale up (1.08x) and increase shadow dramatically
  - Inactive: Items return to normal
  - Smooth snap-into-place animations as items reorder
  - Long-press to drag (no visible drag handles needed)

### Day Metadata:
- **Clickable date banners:**
  - Clear affordance with TouchableOpacity
  - Natural interaction point for day-level actions
  
- **Reorder button separate from date banner:**
  - Prevents accidental mode switching
  - Clear distinction between "edit day info" and "reorder items"

## üîß Technical Details

### Dependencies Added:
- `react-native-draggable-flatlist`: For drag-and-drop functionality
- Already installed: `react-native-gesture-handler` (peer dependency)

### Key Files Modified:
1. `app/components/MemoryFeed.tsx` - Main feed with reordering
2. `app/components/DayDivider.tsx` - Date banner with metadata
3. `app/components/DraggableMemoryGrid.tsx` - NEW: Draggable grid
4. `app/components/DayMetadataModal.tsx` - NEW: Day details modal
5. `firestore.rules` - Security rules for dayMetadata

### Performance Considerations:
- **Order updates**: Batch-written to Firestore (all items in a day)
- **Memory sorting**: Uses `useMemo` to avoid re-sorting on every render
- **Metadata fetching**: Each DayDivider fetches its own metadata (could be optimized with batch fetching in the future)
- **Grid rendering**: Uses `react-native-draggable-flatlist` with `numColumns={2}` for efficient multi-column rendering
- **Gesture handling**: Leverages `react-native-gesture-handler` for native performance

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't scroll through different days
**Solution:** This was fixed! The grid now only uses `DraggableFlatList` when in reorder mode. In normal mode, it renders a standard grid that doesn't interfere with scrolling.

### Issue: Drag animation is jolty/not smooth
**Solution:** Fixed with:
- Smooth spring animation config (damping: 20, stiffness: 100)
- Reduced visual effects (opacity instead of scale)
- Better shadow transitions
- `activationDistance: 10` for more responsive dragging

### Issue: Drag-and-drop not working
**Solution:** Make sure gesture handler is properly installed:
```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
npx expo start --dev-client --clear
```
Rebuild in Xcode.

### Issue: Order not saving
**Solution:** Check Firestore rules are deployed and user is authenticated.

### Issue: Day metadata not showing
**Solution:** 
1. Check Firestore console for `dayMetadata` collection
2. Verify document ID format: `{userId}_{YYYY-MM-DD}`
3. Check console logs for any errors

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Potential improvements:
1. **Sharing functionality**: Implement actual sharing of day content
2. **Batch metadata loading**: Fetch all day metadata in one query
3. **Multi-column drag-and-drop**: Custom implementation for grid reordering
4. **Undo/redo**: Add ability to undo reordering
5. **Drag between days**: Allow moving items between different days
6. **Day templates**: Save and reuse day metadata templates

## üìù Testing Checklist

- [ ] Tap date banner opens Day Details modal
- [ ] Add title and caption, verify they appear in date banner
- [ ] Tap reorder button enters reorder mode
- [ ] Long-press and drag items to reorder them within the 2-column grid
- [ ] Items snap into place smoothly as you drag (Apple Photos-like)
- [ ] Tap "Done" exits reorder mode
- [ ] Order persists after app restart
- [ ] Long-press on memory in normal mode still opens options modal
- [ ] Favorite/delete still work in normal mode
- [ ] Normal interactions (tap, favorite) are disabled while dragging
- [ ] Grid layout remains 2 columns in both normal and reorder mode

---

## üí° Notes

- **Reorder mode is per-day**: Only one day can be in reorder mode at a time
- **2-column grid always**: Layout never changes - just like Apple Photos!
- **Long-press behavior changes**: In normal mode, opens options modal; in reorder mode, starts drag
- **Order field is optional**: Existing memories without `order` field will sort by date
- **Day metadata is user-specific**: Each user has their own metadata for each day
- **Performance**: Reordering updates all items in a day (batch write to Firestore)
- **Visual feedback**: Items scale up and shadow increases while dragging for clear feedback
